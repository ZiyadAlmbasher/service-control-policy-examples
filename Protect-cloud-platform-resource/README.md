## Protect cloud platform resource examples

Enforce controls to protect your resources in cloud from being modified or deleted. 

| Included Policy | Rational | 
|------|-------------|
|[Deny unwanted cancellation or changes to AWS Marketplace product subscription](Deny-unwanted-cancellation-or-changes-to-AWS-Marketplace-product-subscription.json)| Restrict AWS Marketplace product subscription changes to privileged role|
| [Deny users from deleting Amazon VPC flow logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples_vpc.html#example_vpc_1)|Deny users or roles in any affected account from deleting Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) flow logs or CloudWatch log groups or log streams.|
| [Deny creation of default VPC and Subnet](Deny-creation-of-default-VPC-and-subnet.json) | All VPCs and Subnets are created by the Network team following specific configurations.|
| [Deny modifications to specific SNS topics](Deny-modifications-to-specific-SNS-topics.json)|Protect infrastructure automation solution SNS Topics. If you use AWS Control Tower, refer to [Disallow Changes to Amazon SNS Set Up by AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/mandatory-controls.html#sns-disallow-changes) applied by default.|
| [Deny modifications to specific Amazon Lambda functions](Deny-modifications-to-specific-Amazon-Lambda-functions.json) |Platform solutions deploy Lambda functions that need protection. If you use AWS Control Tower, refer to [Disallow Changes to AWS Lambda Functions Set Up by AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/mandatory-controls.html#lambda-disallow-changes) applied by default.|
| [Deny disabling default EBS encryption](Deny-disabling-default-EBS-encryption.json)|Require all EBS volumes are encrypted by default. Note : Enable your accounts for [encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_key_mgmt) before implementing this policy.|
| [Deny KMS key deletion](Deny-KMS-key-deletion.json) |Deny the accidental or intentional deletion of a KMS key and only allow specific roles to delete KMS keys.|
| [Deny modifications to specific AWS CloudFormation resources](Deny-modifications-to-specific-AWS-CloudFormation-resources.json) |Restrict CloudFormation actions to specific CloudFormation Stacks and StackSets that were created by an infrastructure automation framework. If you use AWS Control Tower, refer to [Disallow Changes to AWS IAM Roles Set Up by AWS Control Tower and AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/mandatory-controls.html#iam-disallow-changes) applied by default.|
| [Protect privileged policies from being updated/deleted](Restrict-deletion-and-modification-of-privileged-policies.json) |Only allow privileged role to make updates to critical policies.Note: When implementing a policy like this, we recommend adding another policy to limit who can attach policies like this as well.|
| [Deny deletion of specific CloudWatch Log groups and Streams](Deny-deletion-of-specific-CloudWatch-Log-groups-and-streams.json) |Deny deletion of critical Cloudwatch log groups and streams centrally created for monitoring.|
| [Deny CloudHSM deletion](Deny-CloudHSM-deletion.json) |Deny the accidental or intentional deletion of a CloudHSM devices.|
| [Deny key actions on Route53 DNS hosted zones](Deny-key-actions-on-Route53-DNS-hosted-zones.json) |Deny route53 domain transfer, modification and deletion.|
| [Prevent IMDSv1](Prevent-IMDSv1.json) |EC2 instances obtain credentials for the instance IAM roles through the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).IMDSv2 is the most recent secure version of this service, the older version, IMDSv1, should therefore be prevented.|
| [Enforce 30 days for KMS key deletion](Enforce-30-days-for-KMS-deletion.json) |Safeguards production KMS keys by enforcing a minimum 30-day cooldown period before key deletion. This policy helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical encryption keys, ensuring the security and availability of encrypted data in production environments.|
| [Deny-use-of-IAM-user-credentials-from-unexpected-networks.json](Deny-use-of-IAM-user-credentials-from-unexpected-networks.json) |Deny use of IAM user long-term access keys from outside of your corporate network or VPCs. We recommend using [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) instead of IAM users with long-term access keys, as these access keys remain valid until manually revoked and therefore present a higher security risk. If you still use IAM users in your organization, implement network restrictions to limit exposure and reduce potential misuse.|
